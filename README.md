# WEB103 Project 4 - Nomad Hub Trip Planner

Submitted by: **Tom Strzyz**

About this web app: **A nomad trip customizer that lets users build and save personalized travel packages. Users choose from four key features — accommodation, food, transportation, and utilities/services — each with multiple options at different daily costs. The app dynamically calculates the total daily budget as options are selected and saves completed trip plans to a PostgreSQL database for viewing, editing, and deleting.**

Time spent: **2** hours

## Notes

The four customizable features of the nomad trip are:

- **Food**: Street food, Restaurants, Groceries/cooking
- **Transportation**: Walking/biking, Local bus, Rideshare, Car rental

An impossible combination (e.g. Camping + Coworking space) triggers a validation error and prevents saving.
